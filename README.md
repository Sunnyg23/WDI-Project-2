# wdi-project-2

*Brief*

**Technical requirements**

The app must have atleast 2 models, include relationships.  The app must include authentication. SCSS and wireframes must be used.



**Overview**

Languages

Node, BCrypt, Express, Mongo, Mongoose, JQuery, CSS  




**Future Plans**

Adding more Ajax and less templates 


**Deployment**

Stage 1

In this stage i set up a trello to keep up with deadlines on the project.  i then quickly started on producing some wireframes as i knew which idea i was going to pick.

Stage 2

i developed more on my ajax at this point of the project and stared implenting my models and building the structure of the website 

Stage 3

final stage was to add authentication to the site and make the website look real.  i chose to use Bootstrap frameworks.  With this framework in place my website started to look great.


**Conclusion**

This was my first challenge at making a multi page website.  There is a lot more to accomplish, but i do believe that i have taken a great deal from this project, which in turn i will be able to use on my future projects.
